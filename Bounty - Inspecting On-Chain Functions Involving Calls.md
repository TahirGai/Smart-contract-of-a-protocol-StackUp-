Used Encoding/Decoding or Call Method: call

Explanation

Purpose:

The _swap function in the UniswapV2Router02 contract makes it easier to swap tokens within the Uniswap protocol. This is done by going through an indicated path of token addresses which allows them to be moved from one liquidity pool to another.

Detailed Usage:

The _swap function uses a low-level call to invoke the swap function on pair contracts. It does this by way of the IUniswapV2Pair interface that enables dynamic interaction between router contract and pair contracts for swapping tokens.

Some of the parameters include:

amount0Out and amount1Out: These are simply numbers of outgoing assets for trading.

to: The ethereum address where you want your output coins sent to.

An empty byte array with zero bytes consisting ‘new’: extra data sent as a null string.
